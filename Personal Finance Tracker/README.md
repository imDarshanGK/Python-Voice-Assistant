# Personal Finance Assistant

## Overview

The Personal Finance Assistant is a voice-activated tool designed to help users manage their personal finances more effectively. Utilizing speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, this assistant allows users to log expenses, set budgets, and check their financial status hands-free. The application stores data persistently, ensuring users can track their financial activities over time.

## What I've Done

In this project, I have developed a voice-activated assistant that performs the following functions:
- **Log Expenses**: Users can verbally log their expenses by providing a category and amount.
- **Set Budgets**: Users can establish budgets for various categories, helping them stay on track financially.
- **Check Budgets**: The assistant can provide updates on remaining budget amounts and notify users if they exceed their budgets.
- **Voice Interaction**: The assistant communicates with users through text-to-speech, offering an interactive experience.
- **Data Persistence**: Expense and budget information is saved in a JSON file, allowing data to persist across sessions.

## Libraries Needed

To run the Personal Finance Assistant, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pyttsx3`: For converting text to speech.
- `speech_recognition`: For recognizing spoken commands.
- `json`: For handling data storage in JSON format.
- `os`: For file operations to manage data files.

## Conclusion

The Personal Finance Assistant is a simple yet effective tool for anyone looking to improve their financial management through voice interaction. By leveraging modern technologies like speech recognition and data persistence, this assistant aims to make personal finance tracking more accessible and engaging.
