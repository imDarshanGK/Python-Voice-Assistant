Voice Assistant Storyteller
ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project is to create a voice assistant that can tell stories based on user input. The assistant listens for commands and provides an interactive storytelling experience.

ðŸ§¾ Description
This project is a Voice Assistant that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to engage users in storytelling. The assistant fetches stories from an external API or scrapes a website if the API is unavailable. Users can interact with the assistant by asking it to tell a story, and they can choose from a selection of available stories.

ðŸ§® What I had done!
Built a voice interface using speech_recognition for user input and pyttsx3 for output.
Implemented functionality to fetch stories from an external API, with a fallback to web scraping if the API call fails.
Provided default stories in case both fetching and scraping fail.
Created an interactive loop where users can continuously ask the assistant to tell stories or stop the interaction.
ðŸ“š Libraries Needed
speech_recognition - For recognizing user voice commands.
pyttsx3 - For converting text to speech to read stories aloud.
requests - To make API calls for fetching stories.
beautifulsoup4 - For web scraping to gather stories if needed.
ðŸ“¢ Conclusion
In conclusion, this Voice Assistant project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, web scraping, and user input handling in Python. It offers an engaging, interactive experience where users can listen to stories and choose what they want to hear. The project is an excellent learning opportunity for developers looking to strengthen their understanding of Python and voice interaction.
