# Health Assistant with Medication Reminders

## Overview

This is a voice-activated health assistant that helps users describe symptoms to receive health advice, set medication reminders, and get alerts when it's time to take medications. It leverages speech recognition to understand user commands and provides responses via text-to-speech (TTS). The system also stores medication reminders and continuously checks for upcoming medications to notify users at the scheduled time.

## Features
- Voice input to describe health symptoms and receive advice.
- Voice commands to set and manage medication reminders.
- Real-time alerts when it's time to take a medication.
- Persistent storage of reminders for future sessions.

## Libraries Needed

The following Python libraries are required to run this application:

- `asyncio`: For managing asynchronous tasks such as listening to commands and running background tasks.
- `pyttsx3`: A text-to-speech conversion library.
- `speech_recognition`: For speech input and voice recognition.
- `datetime`: To manage and compare times for reminders.
- `os`: To check for file existence.
- `json`: For saving and loading reminders in a JSON format.

## Conclusion

This health assistant helps users manage their medications and receive basic health advice through simple voice commands. It uses text-to-speech technology to provide a natural interaction experience and allows users to set reminders that persist across sessions. This can be expanded with more detailed health advice and integration with external APIs for more advanced features.
