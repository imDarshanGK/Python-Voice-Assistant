This project is a Scrapy-based web scraper that extracts topics and repositories from GitHub and applies a summarization model for processing the scraped data. It can efficiently gather information about GitHub repositories, including the repository name, description, topics, and more.

## Features

- **Scrapes GitHub repositories**: Extracts key information such as repository name, description, and associated topics.
- **Proxy support**: Handles IP rotation and proxies to avoid getting blocked during scraping.
- **Summarization Model**: Utilizes a summarization model (like BERT) to condense repository descriptions for further analysis.
- **NLP Integration**: Processes the extracted content using NLP techniques, extracting relevant keywords and insights.

- Python 3.7+
- Scrapy
- BeautifulSoup (for additional parsing)
- Hugging Face transformers (for NLP tasks)
