# Voice-Activated Coding System

## Overview

The Voice-Activated Coding System lets users generate code snippets through voice commands. By using speech recognition and OpenAI's language model, the application simplifies the coding process and makes it more interactive.

## Libraries Used

speech_recognition: Converts spoken language into text.

pyttsx3: Provides text-to-speech capabilities.

openai: Interacts with OpenAI's API to generate code based on prompts.

## What I Added

Error Handling: Improved responses when the system doesn't understand a command.

Exit Command: Users can say "exit" to close the application easily.

Interactive Feedback: After generating code, the system prompts users for further requests or to exit.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining speech recognition with AI can create a more intuitive coding experience. With its user-friendly features, the application is a solid foundation for future enhancements.
