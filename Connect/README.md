# Connect

## Overview
Connect is a Python-based voice communication application for real-time audio communication over a local network. It features encryption for secure audio transmission and user authentication.

## What I've Done
I developed a voice communication app that enables live audio chats between multiple users. It includes encryption for privacy, dynamic client management, and basic logging.

## Libraries Used
- pyaudio: For audio capture and playback.
- cryptography: For encrypting and decrypting audio data.
- What the Code Does
- Real-Time Audio Capture: Streams audio from the microphone to connected clients.
- Encryption: Secures audio data using the cryptography library.
- User Authentication: Users provide a unique username to join the session.
- Dynamic Client Management: Users can join or leave at any time.
- Logging: Tracks events and errors for monitoring.

## Commands
- Join: join <username>.
- Leave: leave to disconnect.
- Exit: exit to terminate the application.

## Conclusion
Connect is a foundational tool for live voice communication, with potential for future enhancements like stronger encryption and a graphical user interface.
